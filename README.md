**Chapter-wise Python code examples and practice sets — no theory, just hands-on learning.**  

Welcome to my Python Learning repository!  

In this repo, I have covered **all major Python topics** organized chapter-wise.  

- Each chapter contains **code examples** related to the topic — no long theory, just practical coding.  
- I have also included **practice sets** to help reinforce what I learned by solving real problems.  

This folder shows my journey learning Python step-by-step through hands-on coding.  

Feel free to explore, learn, and give feedback!

**Happy coding!**
